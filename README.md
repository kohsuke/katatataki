# かたたたき puzzle

As a 2025 Christmas gift, my wife gave me a puzzle book filled with this particular puzzle. I was solving it first by myself, with a pencil, but soon I found myself erasing and redoing the puzzle too many times. Clearly, I'm failing to meticulously apply the rules I've discovered. So I decided to bring out the big gun — programming!

Press "solve" and the solver will make progress.  The solver is not equipped with all the rules necessary to solve every puzzle. You can help it by clicking borders.

This is also my frontend programming practice project.
